# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

.DS_Store
/coverage

# Ignore bundler config
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp

*.sw*


# Ignore Railroady generated files
/doc/*.svg

# Don't keep track of generated model graphs, as they generally won't be kept up to date
# Can be generated as needed
*models.png
*models-no-magic.png

# Ignore vim session files
Session.vim
